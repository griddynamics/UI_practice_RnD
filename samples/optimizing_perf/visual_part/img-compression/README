## Avif and Webp demo

This is a proof of concept illustrating the benefits of using [`webp`](https://web.dev/serve-images-webp/) and [`avif`](https://web.dev/compress-images-avif/) image compression formats .
The POC **isn't production ready** and serves the informational purpose only.

## Usage manual
* Place your unoptimized images (assumed `jpeg`) at `/jpeg-img`.
* `npm run inject:gallery:raw` to generate a `jpeg` images gallery html in `index.html`.
* `npm run create:gallery:avif` to generate a gallery of `avif` images.
* `npm run create:gallery:avif-lazy` to generate a gallery of `avif` images loaded lazily.
* `npm run create:gallery:webp` to generate a gallery of `webp` images.
* `npm run start:dev` to launch a web server. Navigate to:
-- `localhost:3000/index.html` to access a page version with `jpeg` images
-- `localhost:3000/index-avif.html` to access a a page version with `avif` images
-- `localhost:3000/index-webp.html` to access a a page version with `webp` images

## Verifying performance results
* Use [`PageSpeed Insights`](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) to compare three versions (`jpeg`, `avif`, `webp`).
